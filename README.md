```python
...

    name="care_scribe",
    package_name="git+https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care_scribe.git",
    version="@master",
    configs={
        "SCRIBE_API_PROVIDER": "openai",  # or "azure" or "google"
=       "SCRIBE_PROVIDER_API_KEY": "my-api-key" # not required if API_PROVIDER is "google"
        "SCRIBE_AUDIO_MODEL_NAME": "",  # model name for speech to text - Not required for Google
        "SCRIBE_CHAT_MODEL_NAME": "",  # model name for chat completion

        # Azure OpenAI Configs
        "SCRIBE_AZURE_API_VERSION": "",
        "SCRIBE_AZURE_ENDPOINT": "",

        # Google Configs
        "SCRIBE_GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID": "my-gcp-project",
        "SCRIBE_GOOGLE_LOCATION": "us-central1",
